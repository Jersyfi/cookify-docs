## Simple (Core & UI) or Advanced (Core)

For beginners i suggest to start with the [Getting Started (UI)](getting-started/installation) where the logic and UI interface is provided directly.<br/>
When you need only the logic and want to create your own UI interface then start right of with the [Advanced Guide (Core)](advanced-guide/installation).

## Framework Support & Features
You can view all library languages and supported features [here](https://github.com/Jersyfi/cookify#framework-support--features).
