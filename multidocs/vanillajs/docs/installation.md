js-cookify is essentially a set of npm packages.

## Install in your Project

To start with that project you can simple install Cookify with npm.

```bash
npm install cookify
```

After that you need to import the npm module correctly. How you need to import the npm correctly to your project depends on you. I will give an simple example for importing a npm module and how to initialize it in ordner to use the functions correctly.

```javascript
import Cookify from Cookify

var cookify = new Cookify
```
